Let $\mathbb{B}_p^N$ be the $N$-dimensional unit ball corresponding to the $\ell_p$-norm. For each $N \in \mathbb{N}$ we sample a uniform random subspace $E_N$ of fixed dimension $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and consider the volume of $\mathbb{B}_p^N$ projected onto $E_N$ or intersected with $E_N$. We also consider geometric quantities other than the volume such as the intrinsic volumes or the dual volumes. In this setting we prove central limit theorems, moderate deviation principles, and large deviation principles as $N \to \infty$. Our results provide a complete asymptotic picture. In particular, they generalize and complement a result of Paouris, Pivovarov, and Zinn [A central limit theorem for projections of the cube, Probab. Theory Related Fields. 159 (2014), 701-719] and another result of Adamczak, Pivovarov, and Simanjuntak [Limit theorems for the volumes of small codimensional random sections of $\ell_p^n$-balls, Ann. Probab. 52 (2024), 93-126].
