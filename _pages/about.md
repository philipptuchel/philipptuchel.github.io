I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Ruhr University Bochum, working under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Christoph Th√§le](https://sites.google.com/view/christophthaele). Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Mathematics at the same university and worked as a research assistant at the [Hahn-Schickard Institute for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.hahn-schickard.de/forschung-entwicklung/kuenstliche-intelligenz). Feel free to explore my [CV](/cv/) and [publications](/publications/) for more details. If you have any questions, please [contact me](/contact/).
